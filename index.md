<h2>ðŸ¥‡ First Place: 71.9 Yards<a href="/siteinfo" style="color: blue">*</a></h2> <!-- consider using icons next to each bullet -->
<h3>Aaron Rodgers</h3>
<h4>Green Bay Packers vs. Detriot Lions, September 25, 2016</h4>

This throw is absolutely incredible. Somehow, the longest throw in football history was made while escaping pressure, on the run, rolling out to the non-throwing side, and appears like it was on-target for a potential TD. This was so unlikely that we've closely monitored all of Rodgers longest throws ever since, assuming he would outpace this sometime when he has a clean pocket and can set his feet. It hasn't happened yet. A stunning accomplishment that went largely overlooked.

<h2>ðŸ¥ˆ Second Place: 71.7 Yards</h2> <!-- consider using icons next to each bullet -->
<h3>Kordell Stewart: The Miracle at Michigan</h3>
<h4>Colorado Buffaloes vs. Michigan Wolverines, September 24, 1994</h4>

<span class="image fit">

<div style="padding:73.39% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1009390158?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Kordell Stewart's Hail Mary against Michigan"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<br>
This play is so epic that it has [its own Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_at_Michigan). 7th ranked Colorado against 4th ranked Michigan, in Michigan. With Colorado down by 5, Stewart launches a Hail Mary from his own 27 yard line. This 72.5 yard bomb gets deflected [(but we don't include that in measurements)]({% link siteinfo.md %}) into the end zone and caught for the upset victory. Most QBs couldn't get that Hail Mary to the end zone; Stewart's incredible arm power fully pays off here.

<h2>ðŸ¥‰ Third Place: 71.2 Yards</h2> <!-- consider using icons next to each bullet -->
<h3>Baker Mayfield</h3>
<h4>Cleveland Browns vs. Baltimore Ravens, December 14, 2020</h4>

<span class="image fit">

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1009396139?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Baker Mayfield's 71.2 Yard Throw"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<br>
We're not sure this one has as good a story as either of the previous two, but it's a fantastically long throw that is the final one to hit the 71 yard threshold. Baker actually overthrows this Hail Mary attempt; if the play started 2-3 yards further back, this might have been an incredible touchdown, as the receiver seems to have a shot at catching this in-stride if it were inbounds.

<h2>ðŸ¥‡ First Place: 76.25 Yards<a href="/siteinfo" style="color: blue">*</a></h2> <!-- consider using icons next to each bullet -->
<h3>Patrick Mahomes</h3>
<h4>Texas Tech Pro Day, 2017</h4>

<span class="image fit">

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1011540601?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Pat Mahomes Pro Day Throw"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<br>
This is the furthest verifiable throw of a regulation football. Mahomes launches it as his final throw in front of NFL staff pre-draft, a whopping 76.25 yards. Amazing. Even though Rodgers has thrown the furthest in-game ball, it appears Mahomes may own the title of strongest arm.

<h3>Josh Allen</h3>
<h4>ESPN Gameday, Year Unknown</h4>

<span class="image fit">

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1011540859?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Josh Allen NFL Gameday"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
<br>
On ESPN Gameday, Josh Allen takes a few steps and absolutely launches the second furthest verifiable throw of a regulation football, showing that he is right up there with Mahomes and Rodgers. It'd be great to see a launch like this in-game someday. What a fucking cannon.
