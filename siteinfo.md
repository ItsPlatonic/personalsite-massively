<h3>Site Info & FAQ</h3>
<dl>
<dt>How do you measure the distance of the throws?</dt>
<dd>
<p>We don't have an exact way to do this. We do our best by pausing videos and looking frame by frame to determine things.
<br><br>
For standardization, we attempt to measure the distance from release to the shoulder height of the closest player. Videos are shot at angles; we do our best to determine the yard-lines, but there's a level of subjectivity involved.</p>
</dd>
<dt>How do you find the throws?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Throws were located via a mix of crowdsourcing, Googling, and being huge football fans ourselves. While we think our search has been pretty complete, and we've checked with a number of people + sources, we definitely could be missing a throw that should be on our site. If you know of one, <a href="mailto:info@thelongestthrow.com">shoot us an email!</a></p>
</dd>
<dt>Why do you do this? Do you make money?</dt>
<dd>
<p>There's no ads or profit from this at all. We're just big football fans, nerded out about this a few times over the years, and decided to make this a thing we are dedicated to tracking on this website.</p>
